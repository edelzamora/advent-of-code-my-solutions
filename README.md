# My solutions to Advent of Code

Here are my solutions to Advent of Code (AoC) written in python. I am currently in the process of learning problem solving so the code is not best or cleanist.

AoC is a website with programming puzzles, if you would like to solve some here is the link:

The creator of the site would like users to not share their unique input files. I will comply by adding one or two lines in my tests and/or adding the file to gitignore.
